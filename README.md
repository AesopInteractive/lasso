Lasso is a commercial plugin available from https://lasso.is. The plugin is hosted here on a public GitHub repository in order to better faciliate community contributions from developers and users alike. If you have a suggestion, a bug report, or a patch for an issue, feel free to submit it [here](https://github.com/AesopInteractive/lasso/issues). When submitting a pull request, test Lasso with [Aesop Story Theme](https://github.com/AesopInteractive/https://github.com/AesopInteractive/aesop-story-theme), and make any pull requests against our latest release branch.


We do ask, however, that if you are using the plugin on a live site that you please purchase a valid license from the website. We cannot provide support to anyone who does not hold a valid license key.
